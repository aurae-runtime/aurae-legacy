### Simplified Nodes

A node is an arbitrary node in the system such as a virtual machine, a laptop, a small ARM computer, an EC2 instance, or a rack mounted server.

Each node can operate independently without a dependency on the network or DNS.

Nodes route to other nodes using an encrypted peer-to-peer network.
